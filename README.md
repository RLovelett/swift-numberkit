# Swift NumberKit

This is a library containing advanced numeric data types for the Swift 2 programming language.
The initial version implements arbitrary-precision signed integers via class `BigInt`. `BigInt`
provides all the signed, integer arithmetic operations from Swift and implements the corresponding
protocols defined in the Swift standard library.
